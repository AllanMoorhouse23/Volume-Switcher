This app allows you to toggle your desired voice chat app (Discord, TeamSpeak, etc)
to any volume with the press of a button.<br>
<p>Currently the hotkey is set to the minus key and to actually set the application first choose the target app and
then choose the target process. Some apps such as Discord have multiple processes and so you may have to scroll through the
list of processes for that app until you see the 1st Volume turn green with a volume percent</p>
